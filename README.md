# BSaber-Downloader

Downloads songs from BSaber using data from [https://github.com/andruzzzhka/BeatSaberScrappedData](https://github.com/andruzzzhka/BeatSaberScrappedData) based on their difficulty, star rating and whether or not they're ranked.

To use this just download the combinedScrappedData from the link above and run the program with it in the same directory as the main.py.

If you'd like to use this for yourself and don't want to the default settings: Expert+, Ranked and 4 star+.

Then you just need to alter the if statement on line 20.
